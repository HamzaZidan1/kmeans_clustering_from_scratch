# K-means Clustering From Scratch with FIFA Player Data

## Load and Prepare Data

- **Data Attributes**: Work with FIFA player data attributes such as overall rating, potential rating, value, wage, and age.
- **Reading and Cleaning**:
  - Use `pandas` to read the data.
  - Perform data cleaning and preparation for clustering.

## Scale the Data

- **Uniform Scaling**: Rescale data to a uniform range (1 to 10) to ensure each feature contributes equally to the analysis.

## Initialize Random Centroids

- **Creating Centroids**: Generate centroids by randomly sampling from the data.
- **Centroid Initialization Function**: Define a function to initialize centroids for a specified number of clusters (K).

## Label Each Data Point

- **Distance Calculation**: Compute the Euclidean distance between each data point and the centroids.
- **Assignment**: Assign data points to the closest centroid.

## Update Centroids

- **Calculate New Centroids**: Compute the geometric mean of each feature for data points in each cluster.
- **Update Function**: Define a function to update centroids based on current cluster assignments.

## Iterate Until Convergence

- **Loop Implementation**: Continuously iterate through labeling and updating steps until centroids stabilize.

## Optionally Visualize the Clustering Process

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA for reducing dimensionality to visualize clusters.
- **Plotting**: Employ `matplotlib` to display the clustering progress.

## Finalizing the Implementation

### Run the Algorithm

- **Initialization**: Specify the maximum number of iterations and initialize centroids.
- **Clustering Process**: Execute the clustering, update centroids, and visualize changes.

### Interpreting the Results

- **Analysis**: Review the final cluster assignments and centroid positions.
- **Pattern Identification**: Discover patterns such as groups of star players, younger talents, and veteran players.

## Compare with Scikit-Learn Implementation

- **Validation**: Compare the outcomes of the custom implementation with the scikit-learn library's k-means algorithm.
- **Learning Benefits**: Highlight the importance of constructing your own algorithm for deeper understanding and flexibility.

## Conclusion

### Benefits of Custom Implementation

- **Deep Understanding**: Gain a thorough comprehension of the internal workings of the algorithm.
- **Flexibility**: Adapt the algorithm for custom use cases and modifications.
